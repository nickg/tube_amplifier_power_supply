**Tube amplifier power supply**

This is a repository for a tube amplifier power supply FPGA control. The original master branch was lost with old computer, but the code will be refactored to use hVHDL libraries.

The power supply consists of a PFC, 6.3V/10A LLC, 420V/1A dual active half bridge and an fpga to contorl them. The auxiliary supplies are also provided by a DCM flyback converter built around IW1818
